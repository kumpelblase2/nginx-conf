# nginx-conf
Some of the nginx configs I use

## Configs
- 'nginx-custom.conf' -> Some small changes to the global nginx.conf
- 'https.conf' -> Handle Letsencrypt and global redirect to HTTPS
- 'simple-proxy.conf' -> Sample application proxy configuration (with HTTPS)
- 'static-files.conf' -> Sample static file config (with HTTPS)
